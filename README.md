# NDVI-OSM-Harmonization
Harmonization of remote sensing imagery with OSM data; Combination of NDVI from Sentinel 2 with OSM 
This code is designed to integrate and harmonize remote sensing imagery with open, community-sourced data to generate a high-resolution map of green spaces and their quality, infrastructure networks, and built-up areas. Vegetation information is derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), calculated using Sentinel-2 data. The processing of these multispectral Sentinel-2 images, which have a resolution of 10 meters, was conducted using Google Earth Engine (GEE), a platform that offers free access to continuously updated datasets. For representing infrastructure, buildings, and water bodies, data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database is utilized. This data can be accessed through download servers (e.g., Geofabrik) or directly via the GEE Data Catalog, where some OSM data is already integrated. Building data can be directly incorporated into the code as a feature collection, whereas data on infrastructure and water bodies must be obtained from external sources and imported as assets. Roads and watercourses are then buffered according to their classification in OSM (Guth et al. 2021, p. 7). These classifications were validated and adjusted for Java through random visual sampling. The resulting polygons are subsequently merged and rasterized into infrastructure and water layers. Buildings with a confidence level of at least 75 percent are also incorporated as a grid layer. These layers are intersected with the NDVI, for which cloud removal was previously performed using mosaicking to ensure cloud coverage of less than 10 percent. Intermediate storage of the individual layers as assets enhances the code's performance. Therefore, a version of the code is also available in two separate scripts for efficiency, called OSM_NDVI_Assets and OSM_NDVI_AssetCombination.
